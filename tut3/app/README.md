# Enhancing the FastAPI Server

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completing your learning, you will be able to:

- Create a fully functional API server
- Integrate SQLAlchemy with your API
- Use Postman to test your API

## Quest Details
### Introduction
Previously, you learnt how to create routes or endpoints in FastAPI for users to create, read, update and delete data on your server.

You will now learn how to integrate a database into the application using SQLAlchemy with FastAPI, allowing users to interact with the database through the API server. This means that the create, read, update, and delete operations in your server can now be directly linked to a database, storing or retrieving data as needed. SQLAlchemy's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) feature is particularly useful; it lets you define your database models as Python classes, making it more intuitive to work with data.
